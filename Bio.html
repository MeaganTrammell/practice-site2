<h3>My journey</h3>

<p>I began writing at 11 years old, filling notebooks in the middle of class with run-on sentences and terrible sketches at the exasperation of my lecturing teachers. I wrote my first novel at 13 and had parents who were supportive enough to submit it to an editor. Unfortunately, none of it went anywhere (sorry, Mom and Dad!) and that was probably for the best. I continued to improve my writing through high school and into college, where I switched my major for Graphic Design to Creative Writing 1 year in. I earned my AS in Fine Arts from Northern Virginia Community College in 2016 and was accepted into the Creative Writing Program at George Mason University, where I received my BFA in 2019. In 2023, after limping along for 4 years, I finally attained an MFA from GMU. My major-adjacent career working in a library (all the way from page, to circulation, to information, to collection maintenance) has spanned my entire working life from 2015 to the present. The public library is where I realized my love of writing, appreciated the works of authors I hope to one day emulate, and, most importantly, where I met my fiance Merlin Ahrenadel, a Computer Game Design major. I live with him in Northern Virginia, where I read and write far too much fanfiction instead of working on my own manuscripts.
